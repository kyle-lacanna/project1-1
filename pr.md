1. I really liked the styling on this website. I think for the art gallery it works really well,   especially when hovering over the picture to make it bigger so you can see it better.

2. I think one significant diffrence between this website and my own is the form. On my website I created custom text boxes that match the style of the webpage and are pleasing to the user, whereas on this webpage the text boxes used are the defaul ones. As to which is more maintainable I dont think they are too diffrent. We both share the same shared navigation bar concept in a shared css file. Other than that I think his would be more maintainable just because it has less fields.

3. I think that the code is well structured and maintains good readability throughout.

4. The only other issue I could find was with the mobile website view. The text doesnt scale makes you have to scroll side to side to see the entire page on mobile. Also on the Contact page when making the window smaller the title for the input box ends up moving behind the text box and makes it unable to see what should be in the box. I think overall semantically appropriate elements were selected. As for the CSS I did see some duplication that could have been fixed such as the body element in gallery.css and forms.css.

5. Overall I really liked the website but did feel like when hovering over a photo it feels like if I click on it it would give me more info or take me to another wepage which was slightly confusing.
